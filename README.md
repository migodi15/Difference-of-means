# Difference-of-means
First project of the master: Analysis of the sales average.


The dataset presents different variables about a chain's sales in different baby seat stores. We are going to analyze if there is a difference in the sales average in 3 cases:
- Inside and outside the USA.
- Rural areas and urban areas.
- According to the shelf where they are placed.
